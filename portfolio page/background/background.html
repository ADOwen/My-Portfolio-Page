        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a first generation American. My parents are from Ukraine and came
          here in the 70's looking for opportunity. I grew up in Brooklyn with
          my two elder sisters. We lived the simple city life. My parents would
          take us upstate for the summers to bungalow colonies. My parents
          friends that immigrated here from the same region, would go there with
          all their kids as well. So it was like a small community and everybody
          knew everybody. For spring break we would all drive down and stay in
          the same hotels. I gained a lot of strong friendships through this
          part of my life, which I'm thankful to my parents for.
        </p>

          I started working very early in my life, I always wanted to be
          independent when I was young. When I was too young to work, I would
          break and tie up boxes for this restaruant in exchange for burgers or
          ice cream. My sister still teases me until this day. I worked a lot of
          odd jobs until I started working as a pharmacy technician. That's when
          I started trying to discover what I wanted to do in life. I opened a
          retail food business, studied abroad, came back, met my wife and then
          decided to study the sciences. I got an associates in biology and at
          the time the plan was to get a steady high paying job. I decided I
          would be a dentist just for that reason. Except I didn't like anything
          about it.

          In April of 2017, I lost my middle sister, she passed away
          unexpectedly at the age of 33. As you can imagine this was a big hit
          for the family. It changed my perspective on life and I decided that I
          didn't want to waste it doing something I didn't like. So I decided to
          throw myself into cooking even though it was logistically risky but it
          is what I'm passionate about. My wife and I moved to houston around
          the time, but we got hit hard there with hurrican harvey. We
          eventually moved back to NYC and things were going well until Covid
          hit. It hit the cooking industry hard but it was just another obstacle
          to overcome. My cooking days are not over but here I am ready or a new
          chapter in my story and I'm excited to get started.
